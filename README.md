# Stemming-in-Different-Languages-A-Survey
Stemming is a method utilized to decrease words to their root frame called stem, by removing derivational and
inflectional affixes. It progresses the execution of data recovery frameworks by diminishing the index size. It is
a rule-based approach because it slices the inflected words from prefix or suffix as per the need using a set of
commonly underused prefix and suffix, like “-ing”, “-ed”, “-es”, “-pre”, etc. It helps to understand the text,
enabling machines to recognize how a particular human talk in various languages concerning the place they
reside. stemming algorithms are used in a much broader way to get easier with the information retrieval system.
Suffixes and affixes are usually striped of from the words to get some information but sometime over-stemming
occurs in between the algorithms and due to which accuracy and other parameters faces a quick drop down in
their values. A root algorithm based on Khoja's work, a light stemming (LS) method, a Machine Translation
(MT) based stemmer, and many more Arabic light stemmer techniques and algorithms have previously been
presented. This strategy has wide application in NLP, Content mining and data retrieval. The stemming
calculations have been created using either a language-specific approach, which needs earlier information of a
language's morphology, or factual strategies, which are based on probabilistic concepts to find morphological
variations of a language from a collection of archives. Most of the existing stemming calculations uses fasten
stripping technique. Stemming has long been used in data pre-processing to retrieve information by tracking
affix words back into their root like in an Indonesian setting, existing stemming methods have been observed,
and are proven to result in high accuracy level. However, there are not many stemming methods for non-formal
Indonesian text processing. This study introduces a new stemming method to solve problems in the non-formal
Indonesian text data pre-processing.
